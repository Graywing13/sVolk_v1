sVOLK REMIX
===========
Graywing13's First Project
--------------------------
I am making this sVolk project because I wanted to have some **practice using Java** while satisfying my fangirlness of Dragalia Lost (of Nintendo and Cygames). It is mainly for me.  
- Phase 1: I want to be able to move my character (Marth) around on a 13x13 grid and attack accordingly. 
- Phase 2: I want to add Volk (the enemy) and give him basic attacks that reflect his attaks in the real game.
- Phase 3: Noreen is a happy kitten. 
- Phase 4: I want to be able to have the AI control the other 3 characters (Lowen, Oof, Eze) that can move on a 13x13 grid.
- Phase 5: Add HP bars for everyone.
